## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [GitLocalize Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to [contact@gitlocalize.com](mailto:contact@gitlocalize.com).

## I Have a Question

If you want to ask a question, we assume that you have read the available [Documentation](https://docs.gitlocalize.com).

Before you ask a question, it is best to search for existing Issues in the specific repository that might help you. In case you have found a suitable issue and still need clarification, you can write your question in this issue. It is also advisable to search the internet for answers first.

If you then still feel the need to ask a question and need clarification, we recommend the following:

- Join our [Discord Community](https://discord.gg/mGwnH4udfv) and ask in the relevant channel.
- Open an Issue in the relevant repository using the "Question" template.

### Reporting Bugs

Before creating bug reports, please check this list as you might find out that you don't need to create one:

- **Check the [documentation](https://docs.gitlocalize.com)** for a list of common questions and troubleshooting.
- **Search existing issues** to see if the bug has already been reported.

If you find an unrecorded bug, please open a new issue in the repository where the bug exists.

### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for GitLocalize, **including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality**. Following these guidelines will help maintainers and the community to understand your suggestion and find related suggestions.

- Use a **clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
- Provide a **step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as many details as possible.
- **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to most GitLocalize users.

### Finding Issues

Unsure where to begin contributing to GitLocalize? You can start by looking through `good-first-issue` and `help-wanted` labels on our repositories.

## Pull Requests

The process described here has several goals:

- Maintain GitLocalize's quality
- Fix problems that are important to users
- Engage the community in working toward the best possible tools

Please follow these steps to have your contribution considered by the maintainers:

1.  **Follow the template**: Most repositories have a Pull Request template. Please fill it out accurately.
2.  **Adhere to Style Guides**: Please respect the linting and style guides specific to the language of the repository (e.g., RuboCop for Ruby, ESLint for JavaScript).
3.  **Verify Checks**: After you submit your pull request, verify that all status checks (CI/CD) are passing.

While the prerequisites above must be satisfied prior to having your pull request reviewed, the reviewer(s) may ask you to complete additional design work, tests, or other changes before your pull request can be ultimately accepted.
