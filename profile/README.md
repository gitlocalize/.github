# Hi there! 👋 We are GitLocalize.

### Continuous Localization for the Modern Web 🌍

GitLocalize is a continuous localization tool that naturally integrates into your development workflow. We automatically keep your translations in sync with your GitHub repository, allowing you to focus on building your product while we handle the localization.

### 🚀 What We Do

*   **Seamless Integration**: Connects directly to your GitHub repositories.
*   **Two-Way Sync**: Your repository is the single source of truth. We track changes in both source and translated documents to keep everything aligned.
*   **Developer Friendly**: Works with the files and formats you already use (Markdown, JSON, YAML, etc.).

### 🔗 Useful Links
